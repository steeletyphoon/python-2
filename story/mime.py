"""Mime

You beat the mime sensless until you reach a point where he can not even stand. Then little feathers start coming out of his mouth
and is body vansihes into thin air. A hippo emerges from the distance and cries out to a diety of some sort that sounded like he was
crying for the mime to not have died. Then the big beast turns towards you and gets seductive eyes. Then puts you on the ground and
starts to take off your clothes. What do you do? Let it happen or push back.
