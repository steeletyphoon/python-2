"""Encounter

You walk into a field because you are dumb and have no idea where you are. A mime walks up to you and starts smacking you with an
imaginary ice shard. And then laughs over your imaginary dead body. What do you do? Beat to death, run away like the pussy coward that
you are, or have a nice chat with tea with the murderous mime?
